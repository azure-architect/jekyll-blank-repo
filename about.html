                We build bulletproof websites for local businesses - sites that actually convert visitors into customers without the complexity and monthly nightmare of WordPress.

                    <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Our Story</h2>
                    <p>After watching countless small businesses get ripped off paying $800-2000/month for broken WordPress sites that don't even show up in AI searches, I decided there had to be a better way. We use proven technology updated with the latest SEO practices and AI optimization - no plugin dependency, no constant breaking, just diesel truck reliability.</p>

                    <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4 mt-8">Our Approach</h2>
                    <p>We're real developers, not plugin installers. When we fix something, it stays fixed. We don't solve problems with another $50 plugin - we write actual code. At $67/hour for permanent fixes or $297/month for full maintenance with content, we're a third of what agencies charge while delivering bulletproof results.</p>
